        <p>
            This test is by no means a replacement for a professional audiologist or their testing.
            You should always listen to their advice over the results of this test.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chart shows the percent error of the average for each pitch.
            Generally, all pitches should be close to the average.
            0s are not included in the average.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a more dynamic evaluation of the results, you should choose the CSV file option.
            This will allow you to import the results into a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
            You can then create a chart to visualize the results. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you get a lot of 0's in your results for pitches you can hear, try using the sensitive ramp instead and lowering the volume.
