        <p>
            This test is by no means a replacement for a professional audiologist or their testing.
            You should always listen to their advice over the results of this test.

            The chart shows the gain level at which a pitch could no longer be heard.
            The lower the gain level, the more sensitive that pitch is.
            Generally, all pitches should be heard at the same gain level.

            For a more accurate evaluation of the results, you should choose the CSV file option.
            This will allow you to import the results into a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel.
            You can then create a chart to visualize the results and see where the average value is.
