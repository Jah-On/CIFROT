            On the testing page, you can name the test and set the pitch interval. 
            The default is 200 Hz but you can set it between 1 and 1,000.
            The higher the value, the faster but less accurate the test will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember to use a useful name for the test such as a program name/number or date.
            The file name will end with the side you test (left, right, or both) and test date.
