        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jah-On (John Schulz) and I have bilateral Cochlear Implants.
            I've had Cochlear Implants for most of my life. 
            Presently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering and have been programming for nearly 5 years.

        <h2>Why did I make CIFROT?</h2>
        <p>
            I am sensitive about how my Cochlear Implants sound and I notice that I get more headaches when they sound off. 
            My audiologist has been excellent but sometimes its hard to describe what I'm hearing.
            I wanted to make a tool that would allow me to test my Cochlear Implant's frequency response and save the results for my audiologist.
            I hope this software will help other Cochlear Implant users as well.
